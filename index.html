-Pure JavaScript Brick Breaker-

-Info-
I made this using only 2 files; this HTML file and 1 JavaScript file.
I made this to learn the Canvas API and/or making decent web games in general.
This game uses the Canvas API to show everything, even including custom-made checkboxes and buttons.
The only HTML in this file is the <meta> stuff, the favicon, the basic styling, the script, and the 2 canvases the game uses.
You can access this game's src at https://nuclear-nc.x10.mx/pure-js-brick-breaker/script.js.
I do have the <noscript> and the text inside the <canvas>, but those basically just tell you you need JS and Canvas to play.
